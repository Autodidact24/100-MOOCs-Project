I want to learn all there is to learn about MOOCs - Students, Pedagogy, Content Development, etc.

One way to do this is to put yourself in the learner's shoes. Hence, the 100 MOOCs Project.

There is no well-defined syllabus or timeline. I am exploring this as I move.

Here, I will document my learnings from the courses.
